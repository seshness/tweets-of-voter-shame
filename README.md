tweets-of-voter-shame -> Tweets celebrating the election outcome

Info 290 in-class project
---

The intention of this project was to identify voters at poll booths who were
tweeting when they weren't supposed to be. As people finished voting, we changed
the project to display tweets from users at or around restaurants and
bars. Unsurprisingly, most of these tweets (on Nov 6th) seem to be
election-related despite no special search filters to ensure that this is the
case.
